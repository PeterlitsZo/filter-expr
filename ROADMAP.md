- [ ] Support the `Evaler` struct to evaluate the expression and move the
      evaluation logic to a separate crate (it should be useful if some project
      want to evaluate the expression by itself).
- [ ] Let the `tokio` dependency be optional.
- [ ] More documentation.
- [ ] Add fuzzing tests and more tests.
- [ ] Rename the `field` to `var` in source code.
